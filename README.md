Hardware Configuration: AMD Ryzen 7 CPU@3.20GHz, 16GB RAM, Windows 10;

Python version: 3.10;

DFA: build a deterministic finite state automaton;

Algorithm 1: Construction of a corrupted supervisor under acceptable attacks;

Algorithm 2: Synthesis of attacks;

Verification: Verification of combined-attackability;

Note that examples are provided for testing the proposed algorithms and method. For the convenience of coding, please allow us to abuse some symbol formats. For example, in *.py file, the event a_{01} in the examples is represented as 'a01', and the transition f(0, a_{01})=1 in the plant G is represented as '('0', 'a01 ', '1')'.
